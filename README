This example is an implementation of the animation provided by Cyril Mottier in his blog :
http://cyrilmottier.com/2014/05/20/custom-animations-with-fragments/

All the explanations are given in his article so feel free to read it first.

In my example you will find two different ways to implement the animation.
The first one is as described in Cyril Mottier article.
The second one is as suggested by Cyril, using a single animator instead of creating one animator each time an animation is processed.
